open mytk.py and run. an application will pop up asking you to enter a url link, class, tag, and name of your csv file.
this app is very specific to this url: https://web.archive.org/web/20121007172955/https://www.nga.gov/collection/anZ1.htm

if you change anZ1 to anZ2 you will be changing the page number. BodyText should be your class name, and tags you're searching
for are 'a' tags (just type a). Enter in the name of the csv file you want to save this data to, press exportand watch a 
spreadsheet appear in the same directory. Happy scraping!!
